## 1. API & Data Model Overview
- Extensive RESTful API: accounts, tokens, NFTs, blocks, search, analytics, AI/ML endpoints.
- Knowledge graph via Qdrant, vector search, and real-time updates.
- Security: rate limiting, input validation, error handling, and caching.
- Performance: batch processing, connection pooling, compression, pagination.

## 2. Architecture & Tech Stack
- Next.js 14, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, D3.js, Qdrant, Solana Web3.js.
- Modular, scalable, and maintainable design.
- SSR, client/server components, streaming, and edge runtime support.
- Data visualization: D3.js, Three.js, Chart.js for interactive graphs.

## 3. Testing & Quality Assurance
- Jest + Playwright for unit, integration, E2E, and performance tests.
- Strict TypeScript, JSDoc, and code quality standards.
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions.
- Visual regression, load, and memory tests.

## 4. Feature Highlights
- Transaction explorer, wallet path finding, AI assistant, network stats, token analytics.
- Search suggestions: Google-like dropdown, entity-specific metadata, fuzzy matching.
- Validator boost system: $SVMAI burn, gamified scoring, Phantom wallet integration.
- Performance monitoring: real-time metrics, regression detection, debug panels.

## 5. Security & Compliance
- Input validation, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, rate limiting.
