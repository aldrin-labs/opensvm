OpenSVM is a comprehensive blockchain explorer for the Solana ecosystem, providing detailed insights into transactions, blocks, accounts, programs, and tokens on the Solana blockchain.

## Overview

OpenSVM offers a modern, user-friendly interface for exploring the Solana blockchain with advanced features like transaction visualization, wallet path finding, and AI-powered analysis. The project aims to make blockchain data more accessible and understandable for developers, users, and researchers.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain Data Browsing**: Explore blocks, transactions, accounts, programs, and tokens
- **Transaction Visualization**: Interactive visualizations of transaction flows and relationships
- **Wallet Path Finding**: Discover connections between wallets through token transfers
- **AI Assistant**: Get natural language explanations of blockchain data and transactions
- **Network Statistics**: Monitor Solana network performance and health metrics
- **Token Analytics**: Track token transfers, balances, and activities

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain Integration**: Solana Web3.js, SPL Token
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js, Cytoscape, Three.js, Chart.js
- **AI Components**: LLM integration via Together AI
- **State Management**: XState for complex workflows
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant for similarity search

```

**Key Architectural Principles:**
- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast response times and efficient resource usage
- **Scalability**: Designed for horizontal scaling and growth
- **Maintainability**: Comprehensive documentation and testing
- **Security**: Security-first design with proper access controls
