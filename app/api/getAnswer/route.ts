/**
 * This API endpoint uses a modular tool system to handle common Solana queries
 * (network TPS/load, current block height & epoch, wallet balance, transaction analysis)
 * by calling the appropriate tools first. If no tool handles the query,
 * it falls back to the LLM (Together) pipeline.
 *
 * This ensures "tools" (RPC calls) are executed on the server prior to
 * returning the response to the user.
