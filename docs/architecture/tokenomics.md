# $SVMAI Tokenomics

## Overview

The $SVMAI token serves as the native utility token for the OpenSVM platform, enabling access to premium features, AI assistant services, and social functionalities. The tokenomics model is designed to incentivize long-term holding while providing accessible entry points for all users.

## Token Utility

### Social Features Access
- **Minimum Requirement**: 100,000 $SVMAI tokens
- **Purpose**: Access to community features, social interactions, and collaborative tools
- **Benefits**: Voting rights, community governance participation, and premium social features

### AI Assistant & Agent Services

The platform implements a tiered pricing model based on token holdings for AI assistant and agent services:

#### Pricing Structure (Per Prompt)

| User Category | Token Holdings | Cost per Prompt |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Platinum Tier** | 1,000,000+ $SVMAI | 1 $SVMAI |
| **Gold Tier** | 100,000+ $SVMAI | 10 $SVMAI |
| **Silver Tier** | < 100,000 $SVMAI | 100 $SVMAI |
| **Guest Users** | 0 $SVMAI | 200 $SVMAI |

#### Service Coverage

AI services include:
- **Transaction Analysis**: Advanced blockchain transaction pattern analysis
- **Smart Contract Insights**: Automated contract vulnerability and optimization suggestions
- **Portfolio Management**: AI-driven portfolio optimization and risk assessment
- **Market Intelligence**: Real-time market analysis and trading insights
- **Code Generation**: Solana program development assistance
- **Query Assistance**: Natural language blockchain data queries

## Economic Model

### Incentive Structure

1. **Long-term Holding Rewards**: Significant cost reductions for larger token holders
2. **Accessibility**: Multiple entry points prevent exclusion while rewarding commitment
3. **Utility-Driven Demand**: Token usage for core platform features creates sustained demand
4. **Guest Access**: Ensures platform accessibility for evaluation and onboarding

### Token Burn Mechanism

- **Service Payments**: A percentage of tokens paid for AI services are burned, creating deflationary pressure
- **Fee Distribution**: Remaining tokens are distributed to platform development and ecosystem rewards
