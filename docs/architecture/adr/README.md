# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the OpenSVM project. ADRs document architectural decisions made during the development process, including the context, options considered, and reasoning behind each decision.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Title**: Brief description of the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: Background and problem statement
- **Decision**: The architectural decision made
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes
- **Alternatives**: Other options considered

## Current ADRs

- [ADR-001: Vector Database Selection](./001-vector-database-selection.md)
- [ADR-002: Frontend Framework Choice](./002-frontend-framework-choice.md)
- [ADR-003: Testing Strategy](./003-testing-strategy.md)
- [ADR-004: Data Visualization Library](./004-data-visualization-library.md)
- [ADR-005: $SVMAI Tokenomics Model](./005-svmai-tokenomics-model.md)

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Create a new ADR file using the next sequential number
2. Follow the standard ADR template
3. Include the decision in pull requests for review
4. Update this index file

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Describe the context and problem statement]

## Decision
[Describe the architectural decision]

## Consequences
### Positive
- [List positive outcomes]

### Negative
- [List negative outcomes]

## Alternatives Considered
- [List alternative options and why they were rejected]

## References
- [Links to relevant documentation or discussions]
```

*ADRs are living documents that should be updated as decisions evolve or are superseded.*
