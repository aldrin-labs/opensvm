# ADR-001: Vector Database Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
OpenSVM requires a vector database for implementing similarity search and knowledge graph capabilities. The system needs to:
- Store and query high-dimensional vectors representing blockchain transactions and relationships
- Perform efficient similarity searches across large datasets
- Support real-time updates and queries
- Integrate well with the existing TypeScript/Node.js stack

## Decision
We will use Qdrant as the vector database for OpenSVM's knowledge graph engine.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Efficient Similarity Search**: Qdrant provides fast and accurate similarity search capabilities with support for multiple distance metrics
- **Scalability**: Designed for high-performance vector operations with horizontal scaling capabilities
- **Rich API**: Comprehensive REST and gRPC APIs with TypeScript client support
- **Real-time Updates**: Supports real-time vector updates and queries
- **Filtering**: Advanced payload filtering capabilities for combining vector search with metadata queries
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage with configurable storage options

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Qdrant-specific concepts and best practices
- **Operational Overhead**: Requires additional infrastructure management and monitoring
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Creates dependency on Qdrant's specific API and data format
- **Complex Queries**: Some advanced query patterns may be more complex than traditional databases

## Alternatives Considered

### Elasticsearch with Vector Search
- **Pros**: Familiar technology, good ecosystem support, mature platform
- **Cons**: More complex setup for vector operations, less specialized for vector workloads
- **Rejection Reason**: Qdrant provides better performance for vector-specific operations

### Pinecone
- **Pros**: Fully managed service, excellent performance, good documentation
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, cost considerations, less control over infrastructure
- **Rejection Reason**: Preference for self-hosted solution with more control

### Weaviate
- **Pros**: Open source, good GraphQL API, strong community
- **Cons**: More complex setup, larger resource requirements
- **Rejection Reason**: Qdrant provides better performance-to-complexity ratio

### Custom Vector Index
- **Pros**: Full control over implementation, no external dependencies
- **Cons**: Significant development effort, maintenance overhead, likely inferior performance
- **Rejection Reason**: Not feasible given project timeline and complexity

## Implementation Details

### Integration Points
- **Knowledge Graph Engine**: Primary storage for transaction relationship vectors
- **Similarity Search**: Powers the "find similar transactions" feature
- **Pattern Recognition**: Stores and queries transaction pattern vectors
- **Real-time Analysis**: Supports live transaction analysis and categorization

### Configuration
```typescript
// Qdrant client configuration
const qdrantClient = new QdrantClient({
  url: process.env.QDRANT_URL || 'http://localhost:6333',
  apiKey: process.env.QDRANT_API_KEY,
});

// Collection configuration
const collectionConfig = {
  vectors: {
    size: 768, // Vector dimension
    distance: 'Cosine', // Distance metric
  },
  optimizers_config: {
    default_segment_number: 2,
  },
  replication_factor: 1,
};
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Vector Dimension**: Using 768-dimensional vectors for transaction embeddings
- **Distance Metric**: Cosine similarity for semantic similarity matching
- **Indexing**: HNSW index for fast approximate nearest neighbor search
- **Batching**: Batch operations for better performance during bulk operations
