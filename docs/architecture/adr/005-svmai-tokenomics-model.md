# ADR-005: $SVMAI Tokenomics Model

## Status
Accepted

## Context
OpenSVM requires a sustainable economic model to monetize AI services while maintaining platform accessibility and encouraging long-term token holding. The platform needs to balance several objectives:
- Provide fair access to AI assistant and agent services
- Incentivize token holding and platform loyalty
- Create sustainable revenue streams for development and operations
- Maintain accessibility for new users and evaluation purposes
- Establish clear utility for the $SVMAI token

## Decision
We will implement a tiered tokenomics model for $SVMAI with usage-based pricing for AI services and token-gated social features.

### Pricing Structure
- **Platinum Tier** (1M+ tokens): 1 $SVMAI per AI prompt
- **Gold Tier** (100k+ tokens): 10 $SVMAI per AI prompt
- **Silver Tier** (< 100k tokens): 100 $SVMAI per AI prompt
- **Guest Users** (0 tokens): 200 $SVMAI per AI prompt

### Access Requirements
- **Social Features**: Minimum 100,000 $SVMAI token holdings required

## Considered Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Flat Rate Subscription
- **Pros**: Predictable revenue, simple implementation
- **Cons**: Doesn't incentivize token holding, less flexible for different usage patterns
- **Rejected**: Doesn't align with tokenomics goals

### Alternative 2: Time-based Token Staking
- **Pros**: Encourages long-term holding, reduces circulating supply
- **Cons**: Complex implementation, potential liquidity issues for users
- **Rejected**: Too complex for initial implementation

### Alternative 3: Pure Pay-per-Use (Fixed Rate)
- **Pros**: Simple and fair, easy to understand
- **Cons**: No incentive for token accumulation, limited economic model
- **Rejected**: Doesn't create holding incentives

### Alternative 4: NFT-based Tier System
- **Pros**: Creates collectible value, clear tier visualization
- **Cons**: Additional complexity, gas costs for tier changes
- **Rejected**: Adds unnecessary complexity to core tokenomics

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Incentivized Holding**: Significant cost savings for larger token holders encourage accumulation
- **Multiple Entry Points**: Tiered structure prevents complete exclusion while rewarding commitment
- **Sustainable Revenue**: Usage-based payments create predictable revenue streams
- **Token Utility**: Clear, valuable use cases for $SVMAI tokens
- **Network Effects**: Social feature gating creates community value
- **Scalable Model**: Can accommodate growth in user base and service offerings
- **Market Accessibility**: Guest pricing allows for platform evaluation and onboarding

### Negative
- **Implementation Complexity**: Requires sophisticated token balance tracking and payment systems
- **Price Volatility Risk**: Token price fluctuations could affect service accessibility
- **User Experience Complexity**: Multiple tiers may confuse some users
- **Technical Overhead**: Real-time balance verification and payment processing requirements
- **Potential Barrier to Entry**: High token requirements for social features may limit adoption

### Risks & Mitigations

#### Risk: Token Price Volatility
- **Mitigation**: Implement price adjustment mechanisms based on token value
- **Monitoring**: Regular review of pricing relative to USD value

#### Risk: Whale Dominance
- **Mitigation**: Cap maximum benefits and implement fair usage policies
- **Monitoring**: Track token distribution and service usage patterns

#### Risk: Technical Implementation Bugs
- **Mitigation**: Extensive testing and gradual rollout of tokenomics features
- **Fallback**: Manual override capabilities for edge cases

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Token balance verification system
- Payment processing integration
- Basic tier assignment logic

### Phase 2: Service Integration
- AI service payment integration
- Social feature gating
- User interface updates

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Token burn mechanisms
- Analytics and reporting
- Optimization based on usage data

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Payment processing success rate > 99.5%
- Balance verification latency < 100ms
- System uptime > 99.9%

### Economic Metrics
- Token holding distribution across tiers
- Service usage patterns by tier
- Revenue generation from token payments
- Token burn rate and economic impact

### User Experience Metrics
- User tier migration patterns
- Service adoption rates by tier
- User satisfaction scores
- Support ticket volume related to tokenomics

## Review Schedule
This ADR should be reviewed quarterly to assess:
- Economic model performance
- User adoption and feedback
- Technical implementation challenges
- Market conditions and competitive landscape
