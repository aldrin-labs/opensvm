# ADR-002: Frontend Framework Choice

## Status
Accepted

## Context
OpenSVM requires a modern frontend framework that can handle:
- Complex data visualizations with D3.js integration
- Real-time updates and WebSocket connections
- Server-side rendering for performance and SEO
- Type safety and developer experience
- Scalable architecture for a growing application

The application needs to display blockchain data with interactive visualizations, handle large datasets efficiently, and provide a responsive user experience.

## Decision
We will use Next.js 14 with the App Router as the frontend framework for OpenSVM.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Improved initial page load times and SEO optimization
- **App Router**: Modern routing with improved performance and developer experience
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Automatic image optimization, code splitting, and performance optimizations
- **Full-Stack Capabilities**: Integrated API routes for backend functionality
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript support with excellent developer experience
- **React Ecosystem**: Access to the vast React ecosystem and component libraries
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle sizes and rendering strategies
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent development tools and hot reloading

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Next.js-specific patterns and App Router concepts
- **Build Complexity**: More complex build process compared to simple React applications
- **Deployment Requirements**: Requires Node.js environment for SSR features
- **Version Compatibility**: Need to manage compatibility between Next.js versions and dependencies

## Alternatives Considered

### Remix
- **Pros**: Excellent data loading patterns, progressive enhancement, strong TypeScript support
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, less mature tooling, steeper learning curve
- **Rejection Reason**: Next.js provides better ecosystem support and team familiarity

### Vite + React
- **Pros**: Fast build times, simple configuration, lightweight
- **Cons**: Requires additional setup for SSR, less integrated full-stack solution
- **Rejection Reason**: Next.js provides better out-of-the-box full-stack capabilities

### SvelteKit
- **Pros**: Excellent performance, smaller bundle sizes, innovative approach
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, less team expertise, fewer component libraries
- **Rejection Reason**: React ecosystem better suited for complex data visualizations

### Nuxt.js (Vue)
- **Pros**: Similar benefits to Next.js, good performance, strong ecosystem
- **Cons**: Team expertise in React, D3.js integration patterns better established in React
- **Rejection Reason**: Team expertise and ecosystem alignment favor React

## Implementation Details

### App Router Structure
```
app/
├── layout.tsx          # Root layout
├── page.tsx           # Home page
├── globals.css        # Global styles
├── (routes)/
│   ├── account/
│   ├── transaction/
│   ├── block/
│   └── analytics/
└── api/
    ├── solana-rpc/
    ├── qdrant/
    └── analytics/
```

### Key Features Utilized
- **Server Components**: For better performance and SEO
- **Client Components**: For interactive visualizations and real-time updates
- **API Routes**: For backend functionality and external service integration
- **Streaming**: For progressive loading of large datasets
- **Metadata API**: For dynamic SEO optimization

### Performance Optimizations
```typescript
// Dynamic imports for code splitting
const TransactionGraph = dynamic(() => import('./TransactionGraph'), {
  ssr: false,
  loading: () => <GraphSkeleton />,
});

// Image optimization
import Image from 'next/image';

// Font optimization
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
```

### Development Configuration
```javascript
// next.config.mjs
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    appDir: true,
  },
  images: {
    domains: ['example.com'],
  },
  webpack: (config) => {
    // Custom webpack configuration for D3.js and other libraries
    return config;
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

## Integration Considerations

### Data Visualization Integration
- **D3.js Compatibility**: Client-side rendering for interactive visualizations
- **Canvas Operations**: Proper handling of canvas rendering in SSR environment
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation for non-JavaScript environments

### State Management
- **React Context**: For global state management
- **Local State**: For component-specific state
- **URL State**: For shareable application state

### Performance Monitoring
- **Web Vitals**: Built-in performance monitoring
- **Bundle Analysis**: Regular bundle size analysis
- **Lighthouse Integration**: Automated performance testing

## Migration Path

### From Create React App
1. Install Next.js and dependencies
2. Move pages to app directory structure
3. Convert to App Router patterns
4. Update build and deployment scripts
5. Test all functionality

### Future Upgrades
- **React Server Components**: Gradual adoption of server components
- **Streaming**: Implementation of streaming for large datasets
- **Edge Runtime**: Consider edge deployment for API routes
