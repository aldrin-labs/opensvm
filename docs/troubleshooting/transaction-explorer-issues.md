## Common Issues

### Transaction Not Found

**Symptoms:**
- Error message: "Transaction not found"
- Empty transaction page
- 404 error when accessing transaction URL

**Possible Causes:**
1. Invalid transaction signature
2. Transaction on different network (devnet vs mainnet)
3. Very recent transaction not yet indexed
4. Historical transaction outside retention period

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Transaction Signature**
   ```
   ✓ Check signature is exactly 88 characters
   ✓ Ensure no extra spaces or characters
   ✓ Verify Base58 encoding (no 0, O, I, l characters)
   ```

2. **Check Network**
   - Ensure you're on the correct network (mainnet-beta, devnet, testnet)
   - Switch networks if necessary
   - Verify transaction exists on the target network

3. **Wait for Indexing**
   - Very recent transactions may take 1-2 minutes to appear
   - Try refreshing the page after a short wait
   - Check transaction status on other explorers

4. **Historical Limitations**
   - Some very old transactions may not be available
   - Check if transaction is within supported date range
   - Use alternative data sources for historical data

### Slow Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Page takes more than 10 seconds to load
- Spinning loading indicators persist
- Partial content loads but some sections remain empty

**Possible Causes:**
1. Large transaction with many instructions
2. Network connectivity issues
3. High server load
4. AI analysis taking longer than usual

**Solutions:**

1. **For Large Transactions**
   ```
   ✓ Use filters to focus on specific instruction types
   ✓ Collapse unnecessary sections
   ✓ Disable auto-refresh features
   ✓ Load sections incrementally
   ```

2. **Network Issues**
   - Check internet connection stability
   - Try refreshing the page
   - Clear browser cache and cookies

- Missing instruction details
- Empty account changes
- AI analysis not loading

**Possible Causes:**
1. Partial data availability for historical transactions
2. Unknown programs without parsing support
3. AI service temporarily unavailable
4. Rate limiting or API errors

**Solutions:**

1. **Historical Data Limitations**
   - Accept that older transactions may have limited data
   - Focus on available information
   - Use multiple data sources for comprehensive analysis

2. **Unknown Programs**
   - Check if program is newly deployed
   - Look for community-contributed program definitions
   - Use raw instruction data as fallback

3. **AI Service Issues**
   - Wait and try refreshing later
   - Use manual analysis tools
