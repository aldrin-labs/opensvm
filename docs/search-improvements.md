# OpenSVM Search Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to the OpenSVM search functionality to improve the user experience and implement AI features as requested.

## 1. Direct Navigation for Specific Queries

### Implementation Details
- Modified the search component to bypass the search page for specific query types
- Added logic to detect account addresses in queries and navigate directly to the account page
- Added localStorage storage of search query and settings for use on destination pages
- Added `fromSearch` parameter to URLs to indicate navigation from search

### Files Modified
- `/components/search/index.tsx` - Updated `handleSubmit` function to implement direct navigation

### How It Works
When a user searches for a specific entity type (like an account), the system now:
1. Detects the entity type
2. Stores the search query and settings in localStorage
3. Navigates directly to the appropriate page (e.g., account page)
4. Passes a `fromSearch=true` parameter to indicate the navigation came from search

## 2. Search Results as a Separate Tab

### Implementation Details
- Created a new `SearchResultsTab` component to display search results
- Modified the tabs system on destination pages to include a search results tab
- Added logic to show the search tab only when coming from search
- Implemented automatic selection of the search tab when navigating from search

### Files Created/Modified
- `/app/account/[address]/components/SearchResultsTab.tsx` - New component to display search results
- `/app/account/[address]/tabs.tsx` - Added search tab to tabs array
- `/app/account/[address]/components/TabContainer.tsx` - Updated to handle search tab display and selection

### How It Works
When a user navigates to a page from search:
1. The `fromSearch` parameter is detected
2. The search tab is added to the available tabs
3. If no specific tab is selected, the search tab is automatically selected
4. The search results are retrieved from localStorage and displayed in the tab

## 3. AI Functionality with Real Data Only

### Implementation Details
- Completely rewrote the AI functionality to only use real data
- Added API key verification to prevent mock data usage
- Implemented proper error handling when API key is not available
- Created streaming response handling for real-time AI responses

### Files Created/Modified
- `/components/search/AIResponsePanel.tsx` - Updated to use real data only
- `/app/api/check-ai-key/route.ts` - New endpoint to verify API key availability
- `/app/api/ai/generate/route.ts` - New endpoint for generating AI responses
- `/app/api/ai/sources/route.ts` - New endpoint for generating sources
- `/app/api/ai/feedback/route.ts` - New endpoint for handling user feedback

### How It Works
The AI functionality now:
1. Checks if a valid API key is available
2. If no key is available, displays a clear message that AI is disabled
3. If a key is available, uses the OpenRouter API to generate real responses
4. Streams the response in real-time for better user experience
5. Provides sources based on real data

## 4. Context-Based Prompt Buttons

### Implementation Details
- Added functionality to generate relevant follow-up questions after AI responses
- Created a new API endpoint for generating prompt suggestions
- Implemented UI for displaying prompt buttons
- Added event handling for when a user clicks a prompt button

### Files Created/Modified
- `/components/search/AIResponsePanel.tsx` - Added prompt buttons UI
- `/app/api/ai/suggest-prompts/route.ts` - New endpoint for generating prompt suggestions

### How It Works
After an AI response is complete:
1. The system calls the suggest-prompts API with the original query and response
2. The API generates 5 relevant follow-up questions
3. These questions are displayed as clickable buttons
4. When a user clicks a button, it's treated as a new user message

## Testing

All implemented changes have been tested to ensure they work as expected:
1. Direct navigation works for account queries and other specific entity types
2. Search results are properly displayed in a separate tab on destination pages
3. AI functionality properly handles cases with and without API keys
4. Context-based prompt buttons are generated and functional after AI responses

## Conclusion

These improvements enhance the OpenSVM user experience by:
1. Providing more direct navigation to relevant pages
2. Maintaining search context through the search results tab
3. Ensuring AI functionality only uses real data
4. Offering context-based prompt suggestions for continued exploration

The implementation follows the requested specifications and maintains a clean, logical user experience throughout the application.
