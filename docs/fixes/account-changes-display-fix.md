# AccountChangesDisplay Component Fix

## Issue
The `AccountChangesDisplay` component was throwing a TypeError:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'level')
    at AccountChangesDisplay:196
```

## Root Cause
The component was trying to synchronously access the result of `accountChangesAnalyzer.analyzeTransaction(transaction)`, which returns a Promise. The `useMemo` hook was returning the Promise object instead of the resolved analysis data, causing `analysis.riskAssessment` to be undefined.

## Solution
1. **Added State Management**: Replaced the synchronous `useMemo` with proper async state management using `useState` and `useEffect`.

2. **Added Loading State**: Introduced `isLoading` state and null checking to handle the async operation properly.

3. **Added Loading UI**: When analysis is loading or not available, the component now shows a loading spinner with appropriate message.

4. **Safe Property Access**: After the loading state check, all `analysis` property accesses are guaranteed to be safe since we verify `analysis` is not null before rendering the main content.

## Changes Made
- Added `analysis` and `isLoading` state variables
- Replaced `useMemo` with `useEffect` for async data loading
- Added loading state UI component
- Added proper error handling for failed analysis
- Cleaned up unused imports to resolve lint warnings

## Result
The component now properly handles the asynchronous nature of transaction analysis and will display a loading state while the analysis is being computed, preventing the undefined property access error.
