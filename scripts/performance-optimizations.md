# Performance Optimizations for OpenSVM

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve the Lighthouse scores for the OpenSVM application. The target is to achieve a Lighthouse score above 90 on average.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Next.js Configuration Optimizations

- Enhanced image optimization settings with proper formats and cache TTL
- Added more packages to the `optimizePackageImports` list for better tree-shaking
- Enabled modern bundling optimizations with `swcMinify`
- Enabled CSS optimizations
- Added font loader optimizations
- Improved script loading with security policies
- Disabled the powered-by header
- Enabled compression
- Added custom webpack configuration for better CSS optimization

### 2. Layout Optimizations

- Implemented dynamic loading for the Navbar component
- Added proper fetch priority for critical resources
- Added performance-related meta tags
- Improved preloading of critical fonts and resources

### 3. Component Optimizations

#### NetworkResponseChart Component
- Conditionally registered Chart.js components only on the client side
- Used `memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Used `useMemo` for chart data and options
- Optimized chart rendering with better configuration
- Disabled animations for better performance
- Limited the number of ticks for better rendering performance
- Adjusted point radius based on data size

#### AIChatSidebar Component
- Added Suspense for better loading experience
- Implemented proper lazy loading
- Optimized state management
- Used refs to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Improved event handling

#### Navbar Component
- Implemented conditional rendering for the AIChatSidebar
- Memoized callback functions
- Optimized event listeners

#### Main Page Component
- Split large components into smaller, memoized components
- Implemented dynamic imports for heavy components
- Used `useMemo` and `useCallback` for better performance
- Optimized data fetching with proper cleanup

## Running Lighthouse Benchmarks

To run Lighthouse benchmarks and verify the performance improvements, follow these steps:

1. Build the application in production mode:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the application in production mode:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

3. In a separate terminal, run the Lighthouse benchmark script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/lighthouse-benchmark.js
   ```

4. Review the results in the `lighthouse-results` directory.

## Expected Improvements

The optimizations implemented should result in:

1. **Faster Initial Load Time**: By optimizing the Next.js configuration and implementing proper code splitting and lazy loading.

2. **Reduced JavaScript Execution Time**: Through better component memoization and optimized rendering.

3. **Improved Rendering Performance**: By optimizing heavy components like charts and AI sidebar.

4. **Better Resource Loading**: Through proper prioritization of critical resources.

5. **Reduced Layout Shifts**: By providing proper dimensions and placeholders for dynamic content.

These improvements should collectively result in a Lighthouse score above 90 on average across all categories.
