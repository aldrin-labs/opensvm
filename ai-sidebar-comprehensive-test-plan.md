## Testing Methodology

### For Each Query:
1. Submit query to AI sidebar
2. Wait for complete response (plan generation → execution → final answer)
3. Evaluate response quality:
   - **Technical Accuracy**: Compare against official docs/sources
   - **Completeness**: Does it answer the full question?
   - **Timeliness**: Is data current and relevant?
   - **Clarity**: Is explanation understandable?
4. Cross-verify data with external sources when applicable
5. Note any hallucinations or incorrect information
6. Document response time and any errors

### Rate Limiting Strategy:
- 5-minute intervals between queries
- Use time for verification and documentation
- Plan queries strategically by complexity

### Success Criteria:
- Technical accuracy >95%
- Complete responses >90%
- Average response time <15s for complex queries
- No critical hallucinations
- Proper source attribution where applicable
