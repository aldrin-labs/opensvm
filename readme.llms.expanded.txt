# OpenSVM Project - Agent Context Summary (Expanded)

This file expands the original summary for agents and LLMs, providing deep cross-references, actionable know-hows, and pointers for every major area. Each section is designed so that agents focusing on any part will be aware of must-know details from other parts, with clear guidance for further exploration. For full details, see the split files `osvm.lmms.part1.txt` to `osvm.lmms.part10.txt` and referenced source files.

## 1. API & Data Model Overview (Expanded)
OpenSVM exposes a comprehensive RESTful API suite for blockchain data, analytics, and AI/ML integration. Key endpoints include:

- `/api/account/:address` – Returns account details, balances, tokens, NFTs, and transaction history.
- `/api/token/:mint` – Token metadata, holders, price, and analytics.
- `/api/nft/:mint` – NFT metadata, ownership, and transfer history.
- `/api/block/:slot` – Block details, transactions, validator info.
- `/api/search?q=...` – Fuzzy search for accounts, tokens, NFTs, blocks, and programs.
- `/api/analytics/` – Real-time metrics, portfolio analysis, compliance scoring.
- `/api/ai/` – LLM-powered explanations, transaction breakdowns, and recommendations.

### Data Models
All API responses are strongly typed using TypeScript. Example:
```typescript
// Account Response
interface Account {
  address: string;
  balance: number;
  tokens: Token[];
  nfts: NFT[];
  history: Transaction[];
}
```
See `/types/account.ts` and `/app/api/account.ts` for full definitions.

### Security & Performance
- Rate limiting, input validation, and error handling are enforced at the API layer.
- Batch processing, connection pooling, and pagination are standard for high-throughput endpoints.
- Caching is implemented for frequently accessed resources (see `/lib/cache.ts`).

### Actionable Know-Hows
- Always validate input before calling API endpoints (see `/utils/validation.ts`).
- For analytics and ML endpoints, review integration notes in `osvm.lmms.part7.txt`.
- Error codes and messages are standardized; see `/app/api/_error.ts` for conventions.
- For troubleshooting, check `/__tests__/api/` for test coverage and edge cases.

### Cross-References
- Data visualization: See Section 2 and `/components/transaction-graph/README.md`.
- Security: See Section 5 for input validation and error handling.
- Performance: See Section 6 for batch processing and caching.
- For deeper details, consult `osvm.lmms.part2.txt` and `osvm.lmms.part3.txt`.

## 2. Architecture & Tech Stack (Expanded)
OpenSVM is built on Next.js 14, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, D3.js, Qdrant, and Solana Web3.js. The architecture is modular, scalable, and maintainable, supporting SSR, client/server components, streaming, and edge runtime.

- Modular hooks and utility files are preferred for separation of concerns (see `/components/` and `/lib/`).
- SSR and streaming are configured in `next.config.mjs` and referenced in `osvm.lmms.part4.txt`.
- GPU/WebGL graph rendering is described in `/components/transaction-graph/README.md` and `osvm.lmms.part5.txt`.
- For edge runtime, see deployment notes in `netlify.toml` and `.cursor/rules/netlify-development.mdc`.

### Example: Transaction Graph Component

### Example: Jest Test
```typescript
test('fetches account data', async () => {
  const data = await fetchAccount('address');
