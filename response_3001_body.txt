**Answer**

The data you provided (the current Solana epoch information) does **not** contain any price‑related metrics for the memecoin **$SVMAI**—such as its current USD price, market capitalization, or recent trading volume. Those figures are typically sourced from on‑chain token‑omics dashboards, price‑oracles, or market‑data aggregators (e.g., CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, Serum DEX analytics, or the Solana Explorer’s token page).

Because the epoch data only tells us about the state of the Solana network (slot numbers, block height, epoch number, etc.), we cannot calculate or infer $SVMAI’s market metrics from it.

### How to Obtain the Missing Information

| Metric | Where to Look | Typical Steps |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Current price (USD)** | CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, or a Solana‑specific price oracle (e.g., Pyth Network) | Search for “$SVMAI” on the site or query the oracle’s API. |
| **Market cap** | Same sources as price, often displayed alongside price | Market cap = (Current price) × (Total circulating supply). |
| **Recent trading volume (24 h)** | Serum DEX analytics, Raydium pool stats, or the same market‑data sites | Look for “24‑hour volume” or “24‑h trade volume” fields. |

If you have access to a Solana RPC endpoint that can query the token’s **mint account**, you can also retrieve the **total supply** directly:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "id":1,
  "method":"getTokenSupply",
  "params":["<SVMAI‑MINT‑ADDRESS>"]
}
```

Combine that supply with the price you obtain from an external price feed to compute market cap yourself.

### Quick Checklist for You

1. **Identify the mint address** of $SVMAI (e.g., `SVMAI1111111111111111111111111111111111111`).  
2. **Query the token supply** via `getTokenSupply` (as shown above).  
3. **Fetch the latest price** from a reliable price oracle or market aggregator.  
4. **Calculate market cap**: `price × circulating supply`.  
5. **Check 24‑h volume** on the primary DEX where $SVMAI trades (Serum, Raydium, Orca, etc.).

### Follow‑up Questions You Might Consider

1. **What is the circulating vs. total supply of $SVMAI, and are there any lock‑up periods that could affect market cap?**  
2. **Which DEX or liquidity pool holds the majority of $SVMAI’s trading volume, and what are the current depth and slippage metrics?**  
3. **How does $SVMAI’s price volatility compare to other Solana memecoins over the past 7 days?**  

Feel free to provide the mint address or any additional on‑chain data you have, and I can help you pull the exact supply numbers or walk you through the API calls needed to get the price and volume.
