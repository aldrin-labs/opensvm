### Fee Breakdown

The fee section shows:
- **Base Fee**: Fixed cost per signature (~0.000005 SOL)
- **Priority Fee**: Optional fee for faster processing
- **Compute Fee**: Cost based on computational resources used

## Instruction Analysis

### Understanding Instructions

Instructions are the individual operations within a transaction. Each instruction:
- Calls a specific program
- Operates on designated accounts
- Includes parameters for the operation

### Instruction Display

Each instruction shows:

1. **Program Information**
   - Program name (if known) or address
   - Program category (System, Token, DeFi, NFT, etc.)
   - Link to program details

2. **Instruction Type**
   - Human-readable operation name
   - Technical instruction identifier

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk: Standard, safe operations
   - ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk: Requires attention
   - ðŸ”´ High Risk: Potentially dangerous operations

4. **Compute Units**
   - Computational resources consumed
   - Efficiency relative to similar operations

### Expanding Instructions

Click on any instruction to see detailed information:

- **Description**: Plain English explanation of what the instruction does
- **Accounts**: List of all accounts involved with their roles
- **Parameters**: Data passed to the instruction
- **Inner Instructions**: Sub-operations triggered by this instruction
- **Logs**: Program output and debug information

### Account Roles

Common account roles include:
- **Payer**: Account paying transaction fees
- **Source**: Account sending tokens or SOL
- **Destination**: Account receiving tokens or SOL
- **Authority**: Account with permission to perform the operation
- **Program**: The program being invoked

## Account Changes

### Overview

The Account Changes section shows how the transaction affected each account's state, including:
- SOL balance changes
- Token balance modifications
- Account data updates
- Ownership transfers

### Balance Changes

Balance changes are displayed with:
- **Before**: Account balance prior to transaction
- **After**: Account balance after transaction
- **Change**: Net difference (positive = received, negative = sent/paid)

Color coding:
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Account received SOL
- ðŸ”´ Red: Account sent SOL or paid fees
- âšª Gray: No change

### Token Changes

For SPL token modifications:
- **Token Mint**: The specific token that changed
- **Amount Changes**: Before/after amounts with percentage change
- **Significance**: High/Medium/Low based on amount and operation type

### Risk Assessment

The system analyzes all account changes to identify:
- Large or unusual balance transfers
- Unknown token interactions
- Authority changes
- Account closures
- Suspicious patterns

### Rent Exemption

Accounts must maintain minimum balances to avoid being garbage collected:
- **Rent Exempt**: Account has sufficient balance
- **Not Rent Exempt**: Account may be deleted if balance drops too low

## AI-Powered Analysis

### Transaction Explanation

The AI system provides:
- **Summary**: High-level description of what the transaction accomplishes
- **Main Action**: Primary purpose of the transaction
- **Secondary Effects**: Additional outcomes or side effects
- **Financial Impact**: How the transaction affects token/SOL balances

### Risk Analysis

AI risk assessment includes:
