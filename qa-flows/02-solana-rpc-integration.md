# QA Scenario: Solana RPC API Integration

## Objective
Validate the accuracy and reliability of Solana blockchain data retrieval and display.

### Test Cases:
1. Block Information
- [ ] Retrieve and display latest blocks
- [ ] Verify block details are accurate
  - Block height
  - Timestamp
  - Number of transactions
  - Block hash

2. Transaction Verification
- [ ] Search and display transaction by signature
- [ ] Check transaction details
  - Sender/Receiver addresses
  - Transaction amount
  - Transaction status
  - Involved programs
- [ ] Validate transaction flow chart rendering

3. Account Details
- [ ] Retrieve account information by address
- [ ] Verify account details
  - Balance
  - Transaction history
  - Associated tokens
  - Program interactions

4. Token and NFT Tracking
- [ ] Search tokens by mint address
- [ ] Verify token details
  - Total supply
  - Decimals
  - Token metadata
  - Holder distribution

5. Program Analysis
- [ ] Search and display program details
- [ ] Verify program information
  - Program address
  - Deployment date
  - Associated transactions
  - Program instructions

6. Error Handling
- [ ] Test API calls with invalid/non-existent:
  - Block numbers
  - Transaction signatures
  - Account addresses
  - Token mint addresses
- [ ] Verify graceful error messages are displayed

7. Performance and Rate Limiting
- [ ] Multiple rapid API calls
- [ ] Verify response times
- [ ] Check for proper rate limiting implementation

## Expected Results
- Accurate blockchain data retrieval
- Comprehensive and correct information display
- Robust error handling
- Responsive and performant API interactions
