# QA Scenario: Security and Performance Testing

## Objective
Validate the application's security, performance, and robustness under various conditions.

### Test Cases:
1. Authentication and Access Control
- [ ] Verify secure handling of Solana wallet connections
- [ ] Test unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Validate token and session management
- [ ] Check for potential XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify secure storage of credentials
- [ ] Test multi-factor authentication (if implemented)

2. API Security
- [ ] Test rate limiting mechanisms
- [ ] Validate input sanitization
- [ ] Check for potential injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify secure handling of API keys and credentials
- [ ] Test CORS configuration
- [ ] Validate HTTPS/SSL implementation

3. Performance Benchmarking
- [ ] Page load times across different routes
- [ ] Concurrent user simulation
- [ ] Resource consumption (CPU, Memory)
- [ ] Network request optimization
- [ ] Caching strategy effectiveness
- [ ] Lazy loading implementation

4. Error Handling
- [ ] Graceful handling of:
  - Network disconnections
  - API failures
  - Invalid user inputs
- [ ] Comprehensive error logging
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms for critical failures

5. Data Privacy
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data exposure
- [ ] Check for proper data anonymization
- [ ] Validate data retention policies
- [ ] Test data encryption mechanisms

6. Stress Testing
- [ ] High concurrent user load
- [ ] Large data volume processing
- [ ] Extended session maintenance
- [ ] Resource exhaustion scenarios

7. Compliance and Best Practices
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 vulnerability checks
- [ ] Web security headers
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Secure cookie management

## Expected Results
- Robust security implementation
- Optimal performance under various conditions
- Comprehensive error handling
- Protection of user data and system resources
- Compliance with web security standards
