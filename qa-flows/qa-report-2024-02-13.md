## Issues Found
1. Console warning about 'fill' option without 'Filler' plugin
2. Console warning about deprecated 'punycode' module
3. Console warning about failed bigint bindings (using pure JS fallback)
4. NFTs page is not loading data, stuck in loading state
5. Multiple RPC endpoint retry attempts visible in console logs
6. Poor mobile responsiveness:
   - Navigation elements overlap on mobile screens
   - No mobile menu implementation
   - Header elements not properly spaced
7. AI Assistant functionality issues:
   - Chat responses not working in any mode
   - No error messages when queries fail
   - Limited knowledge base entries (only 2)
8. Transaction visualization issues:
   - Missing 'getTransactionDetails' export in solana.ts
   - Navigation timeout errors on transaction page
   - Import errors in transaction page components
9. Missing visualization components:
   - Network Response Chart not present on Analytics page
   - Incomplete analytics visualization suite
10. Solana RPC integration issues:
    - Missing 'getBlockDetails' export in solana.ts
    - Missing 'formatNumber' export in utils.ts
    - Failed block data fetching
    - Incomplete error handling for RPC calls
11. Security vulnerabilities:
    - No rate limiting on API endpoints
    - Raw error messages exposed in console
    - Improper URL parsing and validation
    - Missing input sanitization

## Recommendations
1. Investigate and enable the 'Filler' plugin to resolve the fill option warning
2. Update dependencies to resolve the punycode deprecation warning
3. Run `npm run rebuild` to resolve bigint bindings issue
4. Investigate NFT data loading issue:
   - Check network requests
   - Verify API endpoint functionality
   - Review error handling in NFT component
5. Review RPC endpoint configuration:
   - Implement better fallback handling
   - Add error logging for failed endpoint attempts
   - Consider implementing endpoint health checks
6. Improve mobile responsiveness:
   - Implement hamburger menu for mobile navigation
   - Add proper breakpoints for header elements
   - Adjust spacing and layout for mobile screens
7. Fix AI Assistant functionality:
   - Debug chat response handling
   - Add error messages for failed queries
   - Implement proper response streaming
   - Expand knowledge base entries
8. Fix transaction visualization:
   - Add missing getTransactionDetails export
   - Review and fix import paths
   - Increase navigation timeout for transaction loading
   - Add loading states and error boundaries
9. Complete visualization components:
   - Implement Network Response Chart
   - Add comprehensive analytics visualizations
   - Ensure proper data integration for charts
10. Fix Solana RPC integration:
    - Add missing exports in solana.ts and utils.ts
