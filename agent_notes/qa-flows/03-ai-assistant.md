# QA Scenario: AI Assistant Functionality

## Objective
Validate the AI assistant's capabilities, accuracy, and user interaction with focus on Solana-specific knowledge and real-time blockchain data integration.

### Test Cases:
1. Chat Interaction Quality
- [ ] Test query categories with specific examples:
  - Basic Solana: "What is rent-exempt minimum for an account?"
  - Technical: "Explain CPI (Cross-Program Invocation) with example"
  - Transaction Analysis: [Recent failed tx signature analysis]
  - Program Logic: "How does the SPL token program handle transfers?"
- [ ] Response evaluation metrics:
  - Technical accuracy: >95% verified against docs
  - Response time: <3s for basic, <10s for analysis
  - Completeness score: >90% coverage
  - Code example quality: Compilable and correct

2. Context Management
- [ ] Multi-turn conversation flows:
  ```
  User: "What's a PDA?"
  Assistant: [Explains PDA]
  User: "How do I derive one?"
  Assistant: [Shows code example]
  User: "What are common uses?"
  ```
- [ ] Context retention tests:
  - Reference previous examples: 5 turns
  - Technical terminology consistency
  - Variable/address reuse
  - Time-based context (recent blocks)

3. Source Integration
- [ ] Verify citations from:
  - Solana Cookbook
  - API Documentation
  - GitHub repositories
  - Recent blog posts (<6 months)
- [ ] Source validation:
  - Link accessibility: 100% uptime
  - Content relevance score: >85%
  - Version accuracy check
  - Cross-reference verification

4. Technical Analysis
- [ ] Program interaction queries:
  - Instruction decoding
  - State account parsing
  - Error code explanation
  - Gas optimization suggestions
- [ ] Transaction analysis:
  - Failure root cause analysis
  - Fee calculation explanation
  - Program call sequence
  - State changes tracking

5. Edge Cases
- [ ] Handle specific scenarios:
  - Incomplete tx signatures
  - Invalid account addresses
  - Deprecated features
  - Network upgrades
- [ ] Response requirements:
  - Clear error identification
  - Alternative suggestions
  - Documentation references
  - Update notifications

6. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Response time targets:
  - Simple queries: <2s
  - Complex analysis: <15s
  - Data fetching: <5s
  - Streaming updates: 100ms intervals
- [ ] Resource monitoring:
  - Memory: <500MB per session
  - CPU: <30% utilization
  - Concurrent users: 50+
  - WebSocket connections: 100+

7. Accessibility & UX
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 compliance:
  - Keyboard shortcuts (âŒ˜K for commands)
  - Screen reader optimization
  - High contrast mode support
  - Motion reduction option
- [ ] Interactive features:
  - Code syntax highlighting
  - JSON/data formatting
  - Collapsible sections
  - Copy buttons
