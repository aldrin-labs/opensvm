# Plan to Resolve 404 Error on Netlify Deployment

## 1. Verify Netlify Build Logs
- **Action**: Access the Netlify dashboard and navigate to the deploy logs for `opensvm.com`.
- **Objective**: Ensure that the build process completed successfully without errors or warnings.
- **Expected Outcome**: A successful build without critical errors that could prevent deployment.

## 2. Confirm Publish Directory
- **Action**: Review the `publish` setting in `netlify.toml`.
- **Objective**: Ensure that the publish directory is correctly set to `.next`, which is appropriate for Next.js projects using the `@netlify/plugin-nextjs`.
- **Expected Outcome**: The `.next` directory contains the built assets necessary for deployment.

## 3. Review Redirect Rules
- **Action**: Examine the `redirects` section in `netlify.toml`.
- **Objective**: Ensure that all necessary routes are correctly redirected, especially the wildcard redirect that points to `/.netlify/functions/nextjs-server`.
- **Points to Check**:
  - Correct handling of static assets under `/_next/static/*`.
  - Proper redirection of API routes under `/api/*`.
  - The fallback redirect for all other paths to the server function.
- **Expected Outcome**: Redirects are correctly configured to handle both API routes and client-side routing without conflicts.

## 4. Verify Environment Variables
- **Action**: Check that all required environment variables (`SOLANA_RPC_URL`, `OPENSVM_RPC_LIST`, `OPENSVM_RPC_LIST_2`) are set in Netlify’s environment settings.
- **Objective**: Ensure that the application has access to necessary configuration values during build and runtime.
- **Expected Outcome**: All referenced environment variables are correctly defined and accessible to the build process.

## 5. Check Next.js Configuration
- **Action**: Review `next.config.mjs` for any misconfigurations.
- **Objective**: Ensure that Next.js is properly configured to work with Netlify, including settings for image domains, webpack configurations, and headers.
- **Points to Check**:
  - `distDir` is set to `.next`.
  - Custom webpack configurations do not interfere with the build.
  - Headers for API routes are correctly set to handle CORS.
- **Expected Outcome**: Next.js configuration aligns with best practices for deployment on Netlify.

## 6. Validate DNS Settings
- **Action**: Confirm that the DNS settings for `opensvm.com` point correctly to Netlify.
- **Objective**: Ensure that the domain is properly routed to Netlify’s servers.
- **Steps**:
  - Check DNS records (A, CNAME) in the domain registrar’s dashboard.
  - Verify that Netlify’s DNS settings are correctly applied.
- **Expected Outcome**: DNS records are correctly configured, pointing to Netlify, and DNS propagation is complete.

## 7. Inspect Published Files
- **Action**: Use the `list_files` tool to examine the contents of the `.next` directory.
- **Objective**: Ensure that all necessary files are present and correctly built.
- **Expected Outcome**: The `.next` directory contains all required build artifacts for the application.

## 8. Test Locally
- **Action**: Run `npm run build` locally and use Netlify CLI to simulate the deployment.
- **Objective**: Identify any issues in the build process or local environment that might not be evident in the Netlify dashboard.
- **Expected Outcome**: The application builds and serves correctly locally, mirroring the Netlify environment.

## 9. Re-deploy
- **Action**: Trigger a new deployment on Netlify after addressing any issues found in the previous steps.
- **Objective**: Apply changes and verify if the 404 error is resolved.
- **Expected Outcome**: Successful deployment without encountering the 404 error.

## 10. Additional Resources
- **Action**: Refer to Netlify’s [Page Not Found Support Guide](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/common-problems/#page-not-found-errors-404).
- **Objective**: Utilize Netlify’s troubleshooting resources for additional guidance.
- **Expected Outcome**: Gain further insights and potential solutions to resolve the 404 error.

## Summary
By following this structured approach, we can systematically identify and resolve the underlying cause of the 404 error encountered during deployment to Netlify. Each step aims to verify and validate critical aspects of the deployment process, ensuring that the configuration aligns with both Next.js and Netlify best practices.
