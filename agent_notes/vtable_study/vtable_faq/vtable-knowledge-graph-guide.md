# VTable Knowledge Graph Guide

This document explains the structure and relationships defined in the VTable knowledge graph.

## Core Components

### VTable Component
The root component that encompasses all VTable functionality. It has four main table types:
- Basic Table
- Pivot Table
- Tree Table
- Editable Table

## Feature Categories

### 1. Basic Table Features
Core functionality including:
- Header Management (multi-level headers, styling, merging)
- Cell Management (editing, merging, custom rendering)
- Style Management (text, borders, gradients)
- Event Handling (mouse, keyboard, selection)

### 2. Pivot Table Features
Advanced data analysis capabilities:
- Dimension Management
- Aggregation
- Drill-down functionality
- Progressive Loading

### 3. Tree Table Features
Hierarchical data display:
- Node Management
- Tree Expansion
- Lazy Loading
- Node Styling

### 4. Editable Table Features
Interactive editing capabilities:
- Cell Editing
- Validation Rules
- Edit Mode Control
- Undo/Redo Support

- Batch Processing
- Cache Management

## Integration Features
External integration support:
- VChart Integration
- Vue Integration
- Custom Components
- External Events

## Relationships

The knowledge graph defines several types of relationships:
- `hasFeature`: Indicates a component has a specific feature
- `implements`: Shows what functionalities are implemented by a component
- `requires`: Indicates dependencies between features
- `partOf`: Shows hierarchical relationships
- `relatedTo`: Indicates general relationships between concepts

## Usage Guide

1. **Finding Features**: Start from the main VTable component and navigate through the feature categories to find specific functionality.

2. **Understanding Dependencies**: Use the relationship properties to understand what features depend on or require other features.

3. **Implementation Patterns**: Follow the `implements` relationships to understand how different features are implemented across table types.

4. **Feature Integration**: Use the Integration Features section to understand how VTable can be integrated with other components and frameworks.

## Common Patterns

The knowledge graph reveals several common patterns in VTable's architecture:

1. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Basic features form the foundation
   - Advanced features build upon basic functionality
   - Optional features can be added as needed

2. **Feature Modularity**
   - Features are modular and can be enabled/disabled
   - Many features can work independently
   - Some features have optional dependencies

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Performance features span across all table types
   - Lazy loading is implemented at multiple levels
   - Caching strategies are available for different features

4. **Customization Layers**
   - Style customization
   - Behavior customization
   - Rendering customization
   - Event handling customization

## Best Practices

When working with VTable features:

1. Start with basic table features before adding advanced functionality
2. Consider performance implications when combining multiple features
3. Use appropriate rendering methods based on your use case
4. Implement proper event handling for interactive features
5. Leverage built-in optimization features for large datasets
