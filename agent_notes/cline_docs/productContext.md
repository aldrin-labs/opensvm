# Product Context

## Project Purpose
OpenSVM is a comprehensive explorer and registry for SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) networks. It serves as a central hub for discovering, tracking, and analyzing various SVM networks.

## Problems Solved
- Lack of centralized information about SVM networks
- Difficulty in finding official resources and communities for SVM networks
- Need for transparent and accessible network information

## How It Works
The platform provides:
- A registry of all existing SVM networks
- Direct links to essential resources (GitHub, documentation, social channels)
- Network statistics and information
- User-friendly interface for exploring different networks

The system is built as a Next.js application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, providing a modern and responsive user experience.
