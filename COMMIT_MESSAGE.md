# Workspace Protocol Fix

This PR addresses the Netlify deployment error related to workspace protocol dependencies:

## Issues Fixed

1. Removed `bun.lock` file:
   - The Netlify build was failing with "Unsupported URL Type 'workspace:'" error
   - This error occurs when using Bun's lock file in an npm-based build environment
   - Removing bun.lock allows Netlify to use npm's dependency resolution

2. Updated build configuration:
   - Maintained the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag in netlify.toml
   - Ensured clean dependency installation without workspace protocol conflicts

## Testing

The fix has been validated locally to ensure it resolves the workspace protocol error that was preventing successful deployment.

## Impact

These changes should allow the Netlify deployment to proceed without the previous errors by:
1. Eliminating incompatible lock file formats
2. Ensuring proper npm-based dependency resolution
3. Maintaining the existing build command with legacy peer dependency support
