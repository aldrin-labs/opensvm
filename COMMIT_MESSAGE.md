# Fix Netlify Deployment Errors and Update Build Configuration

This PR addresses persistent Netlify deployment errors and updates the build configuration:

## Issues Fixed

1. Updated Netlify build configuration in `netlify.toml`:
   - Added `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to the build command
   - This resolves dependency conflicts that may be causing build failures

2. Verified code fixes in:
   - `components/search/AIResponsePanel.tsx` - Confirmed bracket notation for '24hrChange'
   - `lib/xcom-search.ts` - Confirmed syntax is correct
   - `components/transaction-graph/TransactionGraph.tsx` - Confirmed React Hook dependencies

## Testing

The fixes have been validated locally to ensure they resolve the syntax and parsing errors that were preventing successful deployment.

## Impact

These changes should allow the Netlify deployment to proceed without the previous errors by:
1. Ensuring proper installation of dependencies with peer dependency conflicts
2. Maintaining the syntax fixes for the identified parsing errors
3. Providing a more robust build process for future deployments
