# Fix Netlify Deployment Errors

This PR fixes the Netlify deployment errors identified in the build logs:

## Issues Fixed

1. Fixed parsing error in `lib/xcom-search.ts` at line 54:66
   - Corrected a syntax error where a comma was expected

2. Fixed parsing error in `components/search/AIResponsePanel.tsx` at line 388:86
   - Resolved an issue where an identifier or keyword was incorrectly following a numeric value
   - Changed direct numeric property access to bracket notation for '24hrChange'

3. Fixed React Hook dependency warnings in `components/transaction-graph/TransactionGraph.tsx`
   - Added missing dependency 'processAccountFetchQueue' to useCallback hook
   - Removed unnecessary dependency references
   - Fixed dependency array issues to follow React best practices

## Testing

The fixes have been validated to ensure they resolve the syntax and parsing errors that were preventing successful deployment.

## Impact

These changes should allow the Netlify deployment to proceed without the previous errors. The code is now syntactically correct and follows React's best practices for hook dependencies.
