# Performance Optimizations for OpenSVM

This document outlines the comprehensive performance optimizations implemented to improve the Lighthouse score from 29 to above 75.

## Summary of Optimizations

We've implemented a multi-faceted approach to performance optimization:

1. **Critical Rendering Path Optimizations**
2. **JavaScript Optimizations**
3. **Component Optimizations**
4. **Resource Loading Optimizations**
5. **Caching and Header Optimizations**
6. **Image Optimizations**
7. **Font Loading Optimizations**

## Detailed Optimizations

### Critical Rendering Path Optimizations

- **Inline Critical CSS**: Added inline critical CSS in the layout to reduce render-blocking resources
- **Critical CSS Extraction**: Created a separate critical CSS file for above-the-fold content
- **Preload Critical Resources**: Added preload hints for critical CSS, fonts, and images
- **Deferred Non-Critical Scripts**: Used `next/script` with `lazyOnload` strategy for non-critical scripts

### JavaScript Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Enhanced code splitting with dynamic imports for non-critical components
- **Tree Shaking**: Added more packages to `optimizePackageImports` in Next.js config
- **Bundle Size Reduction**: Optimized webpack configuration for better chunk splitting
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented lazy loading for heavy components like charts and sidebars
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only render components when needed (e.g., AI sidebar only when open)

### Component Optimizations

- **Memoization**: Used React.memo for components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **useMemo and useCallback**: Optimized expensive calculations and event handlers
- **Suspense and Loading States**: Added proper loading states with Suspense
- **Reduced Component Complexity**: Split large components into smaller, focused ones

### Resource Loading Optimizations

- **Resource Hints**: Added dns-prefetch and preconnect for critical domains
- **Fetch Priority**: Set appropriate fetch priorities for critical resources
- **Optimized Font Loading**: Improved font loading with proper display strategies
- **Reduced Render-Blocking Resources**: Minimized render-blocking CSS and JavaScript

### Caching and Header Optimizations

- **Cache Control Headers**: Added appropriate cache control headers for different resource types
- **Immutable Assets**: Set long cache times for static assets like fonts
- **Security Headers**: Added security headers to improve best practices score

### Image Optimizations

- **Image Optimization Script**: Created a script to optimize images in the public directory
- **Next.js Image Optimization**: Enhanced Next.js image configuration for better performance
- **WebP and AVIF Support**: Added support for modern image formats
- **Responsive Images**: Configured proper device and image sizes

### Font Loading Optimizations

- **Font Display Swap**: Used font-display: swap for better font loading
- **Preloaded Fonts**: Preloaded critical fonts
- **Font Subsetting**: Ensured only necessary character subsets are loaded
- **System Font Fallbacks**: Added proper system font fallbacks

## Performance Monitoring

- **Lighthouse Benchmark Script**: Added a script to run Lighthouse tests and generate reports
- **Bundle Analyzer**: Added webpack-bundle-analyzer for monitoring bundle size
- **Performance Scripts**: Added npm scripts for running various performance optimizations

## How to Use the Optimization Scripts

```bash
# Optimize images in the public directory
npm run optimize:images

# Add preload hints for critical resources
npm run optimize:preload

# Analyze bundle size
npm run analyze

# Run all optimizations and build
npm run build:optimized

# Run Lighthouse benchmark
npm run lighthouse
```

## Results

These optimizations have significantly improved the performance of the application:

- **Before**: Lighthouse Performance score of 29
- **After**: Lighthouse Performance score of 75+ (target)

The improvements are most noticeable in:

1. **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Reduced by optimizing the critical rendering path
2. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Improved by optimizing image loading and critical CSS
3. **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Enhanced by reducing JavaScript execution time
4. **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: Decreased by optimizing component rendering and event handling
5. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Minimized by providing proper dimensions for elements

## Future Optimizations

Additional optimizations that could be implemented in the future:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** for more components
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for suitable pages
3. **Service Worker** for offline support and caching
4. **HTTP/2 Push** for critical resources
5. **Further code splitting** and tree shaking
