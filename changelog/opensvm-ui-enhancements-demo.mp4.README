## Video Content

This MP4 file would contain a complete walkthrough of the UI enhancements implemented in the OpenSVM application, following the structure outlined in `demo-video-script.md`.

## How to Generate This Video

The actual MP4 file can be generated using the recording script we've created:

```bash
# Ensure dev server is running
npm run dev

# In a separate terminal
node scripts/record-demo.js
```

The recording script uses Puppeteer and Puppeteer Screen Recorder to:
1. Navigate through the enhanced UI components
2. Demonstrate interactive elements like sliders and graphs
3. Add explanatory text overlays
4. Show the transaction graph visualization
5. Demonstrate error handling and demo data support
6. Present the future development roadmap
