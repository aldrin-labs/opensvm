  - Explain how the system now supports demo transactions
  - Show how this enables reliable demonstrations
  - Highlight the flexible configuration options

### 5. Future Development Roadmap (6:30-7:30)
- Show the upcoming features and enhancements:
  - Advanced transaction graph animations and interactions
  - Enhanced data visualization for complex transactions
  - Real-time data streaming with visual progress indicators
  - Accessibility improvements for all UI components
  - Performance optimizations for mobile responsiveness

## Conclusion (7:30-8:00)
- Summary of all improvements demonstrated
- Reminder of the benefits these changes bring
- Call to action for feedback and continued engagement
- OpenSVM logo and website information

## Technical Recording Notes

- **Resolution**: Record at 1920x1080 (16:9 aspect ratio)
- **Framerate**: 30fps for smooth motion
- **Quality**: High quality encoding for clear text
- **Transitions**: Use smooth transitions between sections
- **Audio**: No audio recording needed - will be narrated separately
- **Duration**: Aim for 7-8 minutes total length
- **Text Overlays**: Use text overlays to highlight key features

## Post-Processing Requirements

- Add section titles at each major transition
- Ensure all text is clearly legible
- Optimize file size while maintaining quality
- Output format: MP4 with H.264 encoding
