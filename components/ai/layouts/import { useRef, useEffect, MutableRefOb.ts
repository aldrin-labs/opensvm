// Deprecated artifact file:
// This file was accidentally created with malformed filename and duplicate hook implementation,
// causing a React Hooks lint warning (missing dependency for adjustHeight).
// The canonical autosize hook lives at hooks/useAutosizeTextarea.ts.
// We keep this stub solely to avoid breaking any accidental imports while eliminating lint noise.

export { useAutosizeTextarea } from '../../../hooks/useAutosizeTextarea';
