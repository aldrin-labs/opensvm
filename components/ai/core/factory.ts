I can help you understand transactions, account activities, and network performance. 
I have access to real-time blockchain data and can provide detailed analysis.

Some things I can help with:
- Analyzing transactions and their effects
- Checking account balances and token holdings
- Monitoring network performance metrics (TPS, block time, etc.)
- Tracking validator status and performance
- Explaining complex blockchain operations in simple terms
- Estimating token usage for AI models
- Finding paths between wallets by tracking token transfers
- Trading tokens, launching new tokens, and other Solana operations

Please provide transaction signatures, account addresses, or ask about network metrics, 
and I'll help you understand what's happening on the Solana blockchain.`;

Key features of Solana:
- **Speed**: Can process up to 65,000 transactions per second
- **Low Cost**: Transaction fees are typically less than $0.01
- **Energy Efficient**: Uses significantly less energy than Bitcoin
- **Developer Friendly**: Supports smart contracts written in Rust, C, and C++
- **Ecosystem**: Home to many DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and Web3 applications

The native token SOL is used for staking, transaction fees, and governance. Popular applications include Serum (DEX), Magic Eden (NFT marketplace), and many DeFi protocols.

How can I help you explore the Solana blockchain today?`
