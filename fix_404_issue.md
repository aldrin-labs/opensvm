# Plan to Resolve 404 Error on Netlify Deployment

## 1. **Verify `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` Installation and Configuration**
   - **Check `package.json`:**
     - Ensure `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` is listed under `"dependencies"`.
     - Confirm the version (`^5.9.4`) is compatible with the installed Next.js version (`^13.4.24`).
   - **Review `netlify.toml`:**
     - Confirm the plugin is correctly configured:
       ```toml
       [[plugins]]
         package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
       ```
     - Ensure there are no conflicting plugins that might interfere with the Next.js plugin.

## 2. **Inspect the Build Process**
   - **Local Build Test:**
     - Run `npm run build` locally to ensure the build completes without errors.
     - Verify that the `.netlify/functions` directory is populated after the build.
   - **Netlify Build Logs:**
     - Access the Netlify dashboard.
     - Navigate to the specific site deployment logs.
     - Look for any errors or warnings related to the build process or plugin execution.

## 3. **Check `.netlify/functions` Directory**
   - **Expected Contents:**
     - After a successful build, the `.netlify/functions` directory should contain the `nextjs-server` function files.
   - **Current Observation:**
     - Only `.gitkeep` is present, indicating that functions were not generated.
   - **Action:**
     - Ensure that the build process is not skipping function generation.
     - Verify that no errors during the build are preventing function creation.

## 4. **Review `next.config.mjs` for Potential Conflicts**
   - **External Packages:**
     - The configuration includes `serverExternalPackages: ['@solana/web3.js']`.
     - Confirm that external packages are not conflicting with Netlify's build process.
   - **Webpack Configuration:**
     - Ensure that custom webpack settings are compatible with Netlify's serverless functions.
     - Specifically, review the `externals` added in the webpack configuration.

## 5. **Validate Environment Variables on Netlify**
   - **Required Variables:**
     - `SOLANA_RPC_URL`
     - `OPENSVM_RPC_LIST`
     - `OPENSVM_RPC_LIST_2`
     - `NEXT_USE_NETLIFY_EDGE`
     - `NODE_VERSION`
     - `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED`
     - `NEXT_PRIVATE_TARGET`
   - **Action:**
     - Ensure all environment variables are correctly set in the Netlify dashboard.
     - Verify that there are no typos or missing variables that the build depends on.

## 6. **Update and Install Dependencies**
   - **Action:**
     - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are up-to-date.
     - Consider deleting `node_modules` and reinstalling to eliminate potential corruptions:
       ```bash
       rm -rf node_modules
       npm install
       ```
   
## 7. **Re-deploy to Netlify**
   - **Action:**
     - Trigger a fresh deployment on Netlify after ensuring all configurations and dependencies are correct.
     - Monitor the build process for any errors or warnings.

## 8. **Post-deployment Verification**
   - **Action:**
     - Once deployment is complete, access `https://opensvm.com` to check if the 404 error persists.
     - Use `curl` or a browser to verify the site's accessibility.

## 9. **Enable Detailed Logging (If Necessary)**
   - **Action:**
     - If the issue persists, enable more verbose logging in Netlify to gather detailed insights.
     - Modify the build command to include debug flags if supported.

## 10. **Consult Netlify Support or Documentation**
   - **Action:**
     - If all else fails, refer to Netlify's official documentation for deploying Next.js applications.
     - Consider reaching out to Netlify support for assistance with persistent deployment issues.
